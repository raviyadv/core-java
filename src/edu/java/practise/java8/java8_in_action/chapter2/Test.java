/**
 * Behavior parameterization is the ability for a method to take multiple different behaviors as
 * parameters and use them internally to accomplish different behaviors.
 * Behavior parameterization lets you make your code more adaptive to changing requirements and
 * saves on engineering efforts in the future.
 * Passing code is a way to give new behaviors as arguments to a method. But itâ€™s verbose prior to Java 8.
 * Anonymous classes helped a bit before Java 8 to get rid of the verbosity associated with declaring
 * multiple concrete classes for an interface that are needed only once.
 * The Java API contains many methods that can be parameterized with different behaviors, which
 * include sorting, threads, and GUI handling.
